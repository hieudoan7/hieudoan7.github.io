        <p>Today I&rsquo;m gonna tell you my experiences, my perspective about life in general and work in particularity.</p>
<h1 id="my-previous-job">My previous job</h1>
<p>I graduated from University of Science, a pretigous university in Vietnam with long history of great talents, especially in computer science or IT industry. I even studied in honor program, which is a class of top 50 students in 1000 IT students. Having said that, as a new graduate with the pride of a fancy degree, I feel on top of the world. Many companies contacted me for an interview to join their company, and very quickly, I landed an interview with one of the top companies in Vietnam or even in South East Asia, named SEA group, and successfully secured a position as a Backend Engineer in SEA.</p>
<p>I had had no idea what Backend Engineer is back in the time when I joined company. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter to big company like SEA, they are willing to train me, willing to pay me as much money as a 5-year experience software engineer. The paycheck every month has fooled me for a while before I realized that apart from money, my skill, my knowledge or my maturity overall have been stagnated. I grown my skills very slowly and didn&rsquo;t focus on anything, it&rsquo;s all about what the company demand from me. As a result, I lost my desire to work very soon, my motivation for the job droped rapidly to zero and I quitted the job as a must-do thing. These aren&rsquo;t my world.</p>
<p>I want to learn everything, I want to be a do-person, I want to earn people&rsquo;s respect through my talent and hardwork. I don&rsquo;t want to let money affect my decision anymore, and till these days I&rsquo;m absolutely happy that I&rsquo;ve quitted my job.</p>
<h1 id="a-few-months-of-breaking">A few months of breaking</h1>
<p>To be precise, It&rsquo;s been 4 months since I quitted my job without any plans in advance. So now I just list out whatever I remember I&rsquo;ve accomplished over the past 4 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>enjoyed Tet holiday, yeah there are some quite special things in this Tet :))</li>
<li>experienced 10 days of military service, except amount of wasted money, it&rsquo;s been great experiences</li>
<li>100 leetcode problems have been solved</li>
<li>1000 new words have been looked up and written down, hope I&rsquo;ve learned half of them</li>
<li>finished reading 1 book: Wonder (by R.J. Palacio)</li>
<li>Applied and took part in several interviews</li>
<li>Secured 1 position at a startup company which I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention at the first place but felt interested after interview and has become my next job.</li>
<li>Countless messages/verbal exchanges with my close friend, turned out not close anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have to assess my break, I would say I&rsquo;m happy and satified with my use of time. It&rsquo;s not too busy, it&rsquo;s not too leisure, it&rsquo;s quite balance.<br>
Consolidate one or two relationships or something like that, i don&rsquo;t know.<br>
Understand myself a little bit more, learn not to put pressure on my side, learn to live my life and ignore every judges.</p>
<h1 id="my-new-job">My new job</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fancy job, fancy title like my previous job but I feel it&rsquo;s a good place for me to grow, simply it&rsquo;s fit me best at the time. I will commit my time here and fully devote my time to learn, to take my career path seriously and build it for a better future. It&rsquo;s all about enjoy the day and build your long-term goal. In football term, It&rsquo;s like I have moved to a smaller club to earn my playing time and develop my skill &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s all what a young player needs.</p>
<p>Thank you for going so far!! haha</p>
