        <p>Have you noticed your feeling at the end of the day?<br>
And you ask yourself what has caused this, did your actions, activities affect your feeling?</p>
<p>Ofcourse, it does.</p>
<h1 id="i-having-a-free-day-isnt-such-easy-like-we-usually-believe">I. Having a free day isn&rsquo;t such easy like we usually believe?</h1>
<p>People have different opinions, different feeling on certain problems, so I only speak for myself, on my own experience.
First, when I&rsquo;m busy I always dream of having as many day-off as possible for doing nothing. But when I actually have time off, very quickly I start feeling boring, wasted and thinking on psychologic/no-ending problems such as Life, Dead, Galaxy,&hellip;. Do I really have the ability to solve any of them?<br>
As a person as humble as me, I wouldn&rsquo;t think I have something to offer for such problems? Why it still bothers me, because I&rsquo;m simply too leisured.</p>
<p>The point is that you should pay attention to your leisure time as much as your professional time. They are equally important. If you look a Day as a collection of activities you did, you will realize that they are actually not different. Let&rsquo;s compare a Job activity versus a Relax activity, the only thing important to mention here is that they are the same, have a starting point, an ending point, and you dedicate your time in between that period. The view of job or relax is just a psycho thought. If you view that period as the time to enjoy, it&rsquo;s Relax activity. And if you view that period as the time to sell, to do the dirty thing for the sake of money, it will be a Job activity.</p>
<p>The concern can be narrowed down to the question: &ldquo;Is this period I&rsquo;m enjoy or suffer?&rdquo;
You can&rsquo;t decide it all the time just like you can&rsquo;t control your mind all the time. But one thing you can do is that you can pick up your activities at the beginning of the day, or you can change the way you look at that activity if you can&rsquo;t replace it.</p>
<p>One fact about human is that we tent to feel more comfortable, confident, positive when we are doing meaningful things which are benefit for your future and your ability. One simple activity that satify them is learning new thing. So if you&rsquo;ve ever pay attention to your feeling, you certainly realize you feel better after learning a new trick, understanding a new topic, discovering new fields or making a product that you are proud of.</p>
<p>Knowing what you will achieve after dedicating your time will motivate you. It&rsquo;s undertandable because human just like other animals like to be rewarded. Isn&rsquo;t when we were young we were told to study and then we will be rewarded by some candies or time to play game, etc?
We (adults) are just the same person with more years old.</p>
<h1 id="ii-some-tips-or-tricks-to-help-you-get-through-the-day">II. Some tips or tricks to help you get through the day</h1>
<p>The main word to take away from the first part is <strong>Reward</strong>.<br>
When you start doing an action, let&rsquo;s take a few seconds to look ahead and wonder:</p>
<ul>
<li>what you will be rewarded after completing this action?</li>
<li>Is this worth your time?</li>
<li>Is there another action rewaring you even more?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions make your choices much easier, the choice of a 5-year old kid, just choosing thing with more reward.</p>
<p>The way you value an action is closely connected to your goal in Life.
For example if your goal is: (ranked in low important order)</p>
<ul>
<li>Health (mental and physic)</li>
<li>Appearance</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Friend</li>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Hobby</li>
<li>Knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>If an action doesn&rsquo;t contribute to any of your goals, it can be consider as a wasting action. And that action is not only wasting, but it is also a harm to your day, making you feel angry, self-destructed and a long time affect to your mental health. Be very cafeful on chosing actions. After deciding to work on that action, you better write things you expect to achive down and check at the end of action to evaluate the quality of your time. Just meeting your expectation is enough, you don&rsquo;t necessarily try to get more, remember you are in the life run, not a 100m race.</p>
<p>Some tips I wanna sum up to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your value.</li>
<li>Know how to use it wisely by picking up the right actions.</li>
<li>Dedicate to the chosen action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best feeling is when you finished a day knowing that you&rsquo;ve given all your best. Only that, you are living the fullest life.</p>
<p>Another mistake people seems to owe is we always think we don&rsquo;t have enough time, the fact is we have a lot of time just because we&rsquo;re not using it correctly.
And if you argue that your job take all of energy from you, there are 2 possiblities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are doing the wrong job -&gt; Just quit.</li>
<li>You are doing the job in the wrong way -&gt; Adjust, change working style (more active and ask more) and change the way approaching the task, figure  out something worth learning through it.<br>
(A job is just a job, nothing to worry, who has the last laugh?)</li>
</ul>
